# ML From Scratch

This repository contains **Python implementations of basic machine learning algorithms from scratch**, using only NumPy. It is part of my learning journey towards AI/ML.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- Implements gradient descent and sigmoid function.
- Predicts probabilities and class labels for binary classification.
- Tested on a synthetic 2-feature dataset.

### 2. Decision Tree (Classification)
- Implements recursive tree building.
- Uses **Entropy and Information Gain** to find the best splits.
- Predicts class labels for a given dataset.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-from-scratch.git
```
2. Navigate into the folder:
```bash
cd ml-from-scratch
```
3. Run the Python files:
```bash
python logistic_regression_from_scratch.py
python decision_tree_from_scratch.py
```
### Key Learnings
- Understanding gradient descent and cost optimization for Logistic Regression.
- Understanding node splitting logic and information gain for Decision Trees.
- Hands-on experience implementing ML algorithms from scratch without libraries like scikit-learn.
